# Machine Learning and PacMan


This project is a research on how Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) algorithms can be used together in PacMan game with the goal of obtaining maximum scores.

The main literature used during the development was the following book:
- Richard S. Sutton and Andrew G. Barto; Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction; MIT Press, Cambridge, MA, 1998.

This project was made as my bachelor thesis for my Dual Degree in Computer Sciences and Mathematics at Complutense University of Madrid, in June, 2017.
